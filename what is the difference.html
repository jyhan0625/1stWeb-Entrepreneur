<h2>What is the difference between Entreprneur and CEO?</h2>
<img src="difference.jpg" width="300"><br>
A corporation is a legally different entity than an LLC, and most small-scale entrepreneurs protect their businesses by becoming LLCs. According to Start Up Guide, it’s more expensive to become a corporation, but it’s the correct move to make for businesses that want to expand and perhaps go public in the future. There are different tax structures and regulations for corporations than for LLCs, and in general, they’re more complex and expensive to run. Corporations are required to have a board of directors, including a president and CEO, and they often have several more top-level executives occupying the so-called C-suite, or chief suite. A lot of times, entrepreneurs who found corporations hire themselves as CEO, because they are the ones with the vision for how to run the company.<br><br>

This vision is the main requirement for being a CEO, and it comes with many years of experience and often a level of expertise in an industry. For example, Mozilla briefly hired Brendan Eich to be the CEO, because of his decades of experience in Web technology and his credit for developing the JavaScript programming language. Unfortunately for Mozilla and for Eich, his political views caused outrage among Mozilla users and led to his replacement. Eich is a computer scientist and an upper-level business executive, but he’s not an entrepreneur. It’s quite common for CEOs not to be entrepreneurs, and a common path for business graduates to take to this position is to get an MBA and work in a corporate environment for many years.<br><br>
